Take on SONA July 2025 of the Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.\
by Frances Reanna R. Rugayan and Sodium\
\
1) A few things I found interesting from the 2025 SONA are first, he made many promises about what he intends to accomplish by the end of his term and will continue after, which are mostly about making things affordable or "abot kaya" such as his bente piso bigas. Second, his project does not require attending college. Instead of going to college, students can now immediately start working jobs.\
\
2) Something I found weird from the SONA that my mother also noticed is that he intends to reuse a lot of past programs, such as the Love Bus, during the Martial Law that is promoted to be a free public service. Additionally, I found it odd that President Marcos Jr.'s programs are mainly about making a lot of thingscheap and free rice, such as Wi-fi, laptops for teachers, transportation, health care, and many more. I found this weird because it makes me question the quality of these free services, knowing our country's financial debt.\
\
3)  The latest SONA of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. discussed the administration's past achievements, current national issues, and upcoming programs. These programs revolve around agriculture, healthcare, education, transportation, infrastructure, emergency protocols, and many more. He reported that in the past year, they have successfully decreased inflation, increased employment, decreased guerrilla activity, and increased encouragement to invest in the Philippines. The president emphasized the importance of our country's cooperation and discipline to reach these goals.\
\
He continued by sharing his upcoming programs to make many resources more affordable, fighting against corruption related to drugs, gambling, and failed emergency protocols due to the recent natural disasters. Although I believe that these programs can truly benefit the many Filipinos, it makes me question if this is truly possible, especially given the affordability in this challenging economy. Reflecting on his speech, he failed to address the current political tension with his administration and issues regarding the territory of the West Philippine Sea despite last year's SONA. Thus, this leaves a few important national concerns unanswered and more open to public criticism.\
\
4) Are these only false promises?\
