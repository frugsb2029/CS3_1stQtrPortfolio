# Reflections: 

# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Control Statements** - Control statements are very easy to understand. I'm already familiarized with the statements with my prior knowledge in other programming languages. 
2.  **Loop Control Structures** - Since this topic is something we learned in grade 8, It wansn't hard to understand the topic. Additionally, the logic when answering or creating codes is not complex.
3. **JavaScript Basic Statements** - The logic is very simple when I apply this topic in exercises. Additionally, I feel like we used many examples involving this in class so, I became familiar with the basic statements.
4. **Variable declaration** - Since we have apllied this too in Python and C++, I was able to understand this lesson up quickly. It was familiar and not so hard to understand when coding.
5. **Declaring Functions** - Although i studied this in grade 8, I still lack in a few areas. However, I didn't have that much of a hard time. I think, with the constant use of this topic, I was able to sort of grasp it.


# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

1. **Arithmetic Operations** - Although Im pretty sure we learned this in past CS classes, I still find it hard to compute correctly. The order of computation also really confuses me when looking for the correct output of the code. 
2. **Processing Fuction Output** - The order of "computation" confuses me a bit. I dont really understand how to answer/process the code in the correct manner.
3. **Native Functions** - It's not the most difficult to understand, but it's hard for me to memorize. During excercises or assesments I tend to forget.
4. **Event Handlers** - I know little of this topic, mainly because this is one of the longer part of coding in my opinion. Additionally, it requires me to memorize more stuff, which is an area I lack in.
5. **Declaring Functions** - Although i studied this in grade 8, I still lack in a few areas. However, I didn't have that much of a hard time. I think, with the constant use of this topic, I was able to sort of grasp it.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

To help myself understand further the topics I listed on the 2nd item, I plan to:
- Consult since I found it very helpful to have one on one help from the teacher.
- Practice can help me improve my critical thinking wnhen coding.
- Further Studying/Research. If I don't know the topic/want to further learn/clarify something on my own, I think this can be an effective method for me to learn, escpecially independently. 

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

**Effective Activities** 
1. Exercises set as homework - It gives me enough time to think of what to code since it doesnt give me time pressure. 
2. Google form exercises - It allows me to know in what areas I lack in.

**Not Effective Activities**
1. In-class coding exercises - I get very pressured because of the lack of time (within the class period). Additionally, I feel very discouraged to ask questions from emberrassment, thus I dont really learn anything.
2. Group activities - Although it is benefitial for me (if my groupmate is good at coding), I dont think I learn anything much because I become dependent on my groupmate.
